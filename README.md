- Ever stuck in solving a path finding puzzle, let A* Pathfinding Visualization do it for you,
  how complex be the maze if solution exits it finds it.
- An interactive GUI based path finding algorithm using Python and Pygame.
- Time complexity of A* pathfinding algorithm is less than Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm.
